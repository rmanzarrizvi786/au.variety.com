						<p>Robert Pattinson couldn’t stop Googling himself. In mid-May, the 33-year-old actor found himself obsessively refreshing his phone on a flight from Los Angeles to the south of France. Pattinson was headed to the Cannes Film Festival for the world premiere of his new movie, “The Lighthouse,” just days before he was set to start shooting the next Christopher Nolan film, “Tenet.” But someone had tipped off the press about another top-secret project, one the entire world was now reporting on: Pattinson had been cast as the next Batman.</p>

						<p>The stories were premature — Pattinson hadn’t even auditioned yet — and he was horrified that all the chatter would spook Warner Bros. executives into not hiring him. “When that thing leaked, I was f—ing furious,” Pattinson recalls on a recent rainy afternoon in London. “Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.”</p>

						<p>As he scoured the internet for any clues that he’d been cut from the studio’s wish list, the man next to him leaned over to say hello. “I was sitting next to Christopher McQuarrie,” Pattinson says. “I’d never met him before. Oh, God! He’d seen me Googling myself for the past hour!” Pattinson tried to explain to the director behind the latest “Mission: Impossible” films what had happened. “No worries,” McQuarrie said, nodding. “I’d probably be doing the same thing.”</p>

						<p>Watching&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artechouse.com/nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Refik Anadol’s&nbsp;<em>Machine Hallucination</em>&nbsp;(2019)</a>&nbsp;is a dizzying experience, like taking a ride at a carnival. Created with algorithms that found and processed hundreds of millions of images of New York City,&nbsp;<em>Machine Hallucination&nbsp;</em>is a buzzing, immersive audiovisual piece, on view at Artechouse, a new digital art space in New York’s Chelsea Market, through November 17. The gallery is a 6,000-square foot converted boiler room, sporting the kind of scrubbed ex-industrial chic—exposed brick, soaring ceilings—that has become a cliché in New York. With Anadol’s piece projected on its walls and floor, the space conjures both nightclubs and nightmares.</p>

						<p>Machine Hallucination whirs and throbs for thirty minutes, opening what Anadol said in an interview is a window into the “mind of a machine” as it processes images and then responds to them. There are moments when glimmers of New York are completely clear: you feel as if you’re moving over the city’s grid at a great height, or glimpse images of buildings right before they start to morph beyond recognition. Other times, you are looking at the data architecture, at graphic plottings, or metadata tags of the original photos—keywords like COLOR and URBAN and NEWYORK.</p>
						<p>Anadol, <a href="#">media artist originally</a> from Istanbul who now lives in Los Angeles, has been working with data for a decade to make large-scale installations of sound and light—often visualizing open source data about cities—displayed in public space. In 2016, he was a resident at Google’s Artists and Machine Intelligence Program, where he learned how to use artificial intelligence as an artistic tool. He has previously created installations for Artechouse’s locations in Washington, D.C. and Miami, and was invited to inaugurate its New York venue, which opened September 6.</p>

						<p>A custom algorithm crawled the internet to find images of New York on social media, search engines, digital maps, and library sites. Anadol said they all were taken from the public domain because of his concerns about data privacy: his system “never entered a password or breached anyone’s personal belongings.” Once the photos had been collected, <a href="#">an image recognition algorithm</a> defined the context of the original images, and another algorithm erased any people who appeared—faces, crowds, slivers of bodies. Anadol said this choice had to do with privacy concerns, but also with his desire to focus on architecture and the cityscape Another kind of algorithm used to generate dynamic media, known as a recurrent neural network, absorbed recorded sounds from the cityscape—subway sounds, local radio stations, traffic noises—and composed the soundtrack.</p>

						<p>After processing the plethora of audio and visual data, the StyleGAN algorithm was then programmed to “dream”—basically, to spit back visual associations it learned as it reviewed images. This process, popularized by Google engineers, can have surreal results, as when computers thought that dumbbells had arms because they were often found in images with arms. The dreamstate in Machine Hallucination is more abstract—colors and forms coming in waves and patterns, shifting like an Etch-a-Sketch. To the side of the main space, a small room screens hour-long unedited “machine dreams” made from the dataset.</p>
